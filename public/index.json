What truly made a difference was the ability to cultivate and apply essential skills that were versatile, repeatable, transferable, and impactful across both professional and personal domains.\nIn this article, I attempt to highlight some of the skills that helped me shape my career journey. I hope this also offers insights into how to think about choosing skills and leveraging them to your advantage.\nMastering Efficiency with Automation: Streamline Processes, Amplify Your Impact Early in my career, I often found myself juggling numerous tasks within tight deadlines. These challenges pushed me to explore ways to streamline repetitive tasks, starting with small batch scripts and gradually scaling up to more complex solutions. Along the way, I discovered the transformative power of automation.\nI began by learning Perl during the nascent days of automation, then transitioned to shell scripting and eventually to Python. Automation became my go-to solution for a variety of tasks—managing systems, generating antivirus compliance reports, and automating security checks. Each script I wrote not only optimized processes but also reinforced my belief in the efficiency and scalability that automation brings to the table.\nWhy It’s Important: Automation introduced a streamlined approach to processes, creating a dependable operational framework. Automation reduced human error and ensured consistency. Example:\nCreating automated scripts for endpoint compliance reporting not only saved me hours of manual effort but also improved accuracy. This habit of identifying inefficiencies and automating tasks became a valuable tool in my professional toolkit.\nRisk: A Balanced Approach to Success in Life and Work Understanding the concepts of risk, reward, impact, and likelihood not only guided me in navigating both personal and professional setups but also revealed their critical role in decision-making. Over time, analyzing these factors at various stages of assigned responsibilities helped me make informed choices.\nThe concept of risk extended far beyond traditional risk-based roles—it influenced daily decisions and life choices. Grasping its nuances was transformative, shaping my approach to evaluating opportunities and challenges in every context.\nProfessional Insights: Risk wasn’t just about vulnerabilities; it was about understanding impact, likelihood, and mitigation. In compliance and audit, evaluating risk holistically ensured that controls were meaningful and not just tick-in-the-box exercises. Personal Insights: Recognizing risks in decision-making has helped me weigh options more effectively and act with confidence. Understanding various aspects of risk, such as volatility, financial loss, and human impact, helped in more effective decision-making and better equipped me to handle challenging situations. Example:\nThird-party risk encompassed various aspects of supplier risk, from evaluating their solutions to understanding interconnected vulnerabilities. It taught me the importance of holistic assessments while keeping the core intent of evaluation in focus.

Take every opportunity to learn, even if you don’t know what’s best at the time… Give it your best shot, absorb the learnings, and move forward.\nAbout Me With over 20 years in IT and 15+ years specializing in security, I currently serve as an advisor at a US MNC. My expertise spans various domains, including Identity, Vulnerability Management, Incident Response, Audit, Controls, Compliance, Third-Party Security, and Application Security.\nEarly Days I started out primarily as a helpdesk personnel, making rounds in the office to assist users with system issues. This included fixing network problems, troubleshooting monitors, resolving application performance issues, and providing general application support.\nComing from a non-computer science background, transitioning into helpdesk work was challenging but never dull. Each day brought manifold learning opportunities. I began keeping a list of things I learned, taking incremental steps each day. Before long, I was handling more complex issues and managing a site of 300 users, supporting their servers and user systems.\nOver the next few years, my learning curve and curiosity drove me to explore various areas and roles. This journey of discovery led me to different positions, each building on the last. But these transitions didn’t happen by accident.\nCuriosity While working as a Windows system administrator, I noticed most of my peers were deeply entrenched in Windows environments. I decided to explore Linux and open-source technologies in my spare time, driven by curiosity and a desire to stand out.\nThis decision not only sharpened my technical skills but also positioned me uniquely as a systems administrator who understood both worlds. I spent countless hours experimenting with Linux systems and delving into open-source projects. These experiences taught me not just technical skills but also contrarian thinking—a critical skill that would later define my approach to cybersecurity.\nThe Shift My first brush with cybersecurity came early during the implementation of audit controls for Windows environments at a local site. While working through these implementations, I discovered the thrill of auditors performing their detective work to assess environments for compliance.\nMy first official role was in Legal Compliance at an investment bank, focusing on eDiscovery and eRetention. This role exposed me to governance, risk, and audit functions. I quickly built up basic certifications, such as CEH, which helped me solidify my foundational knowledge.\nWith each passing year, I sought to accumulate more cybersecurity knowledge, pivoting to new roles and dedicating time to studying for certifications and applying them in real-world situations. This journey led me to roles in Security Testing, building secure systems, and managing entire security delivery services for a European retail client. Today, I have the privilege of working across third-party risk, application security, audit, and governance roles at a US MNC.\nLessons From the Journey Unconventional Path: Embrace the unique and non-linear career path. Each small step, no matter how unconventional, contributes to your growth. Curiosity to Learn: Always be eager to explore areas beyond your current role. For example, learning Linux while primarily working in a Windows environment broadened my skills. Multidisciplinary Skills: Developing a skill like automation or data analysis can be applied across roles. Soft Skills: Cultivate soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and empathy. These have only helped me in the long run. Humility: Stay humble throughout your journey. Recognize that there is always more to learn and that every experience, whether a success or a failure, is an opportunity for growth. Thank You My journey into cybersecurity is not just my story—it’s a collective effort shaped by the incredible mentors, peers, and colleagues I’ve been fortunate to work with. To anyone aspiring to transition into cybersecurity, remember that you don’t have to do it alone. Seek mentors, connect with like-minded individuals, and pay forward the support you receive. Together, we can build a stronger, more secure future.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/articles/20241225_breaking_into_cybersecurity/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"tagline\"\u003eTagline\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou can only connect the dots in hindsight..\nTake every opportunity to learn, even if you don’t know what’s best at the time…\nGive it your best shot, absorb the learnings, and move forward.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"about-me\"\u003eAbout Me\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith over \u003cstrong\u003e20 years in IT\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003e15+ years specializing in security\u003c/strong\u003e, I currently serve as an advisor at a US MNC.
