My expertise spans various domains, including Identity, Vulnerability Management, Incident Response, Audit, Controls, Compliance, Third-Party Security, and Application Security.\nEarly Days I started out primarily as a helpdesk personnel, making rounds in the office to assist users with system issues. This included fixing network problems, troubleshooting monitors, resolving application performance issues, and providing general application support.\nComing from a non-computer science background, transitioning into helpdesk work was challenging but never dull. Each day brought manifold learning opportunities. I began keeping a list of things I learned, taking incremental steps each day. Before long, I was handling more complex issues and managing a site of 300 users, supporting their servers and user systems.\nOver the next few years, my learning curve and curiosity drove me to explore various areas and roles. This journey of discovery led me to different positions, each building on the last. These transitions didn‚Äôt happen by accident.\nCuriosity While working as a Windows system administrator, I noticed most of my peers were deeply entrenched in Windows environments. I decided to explore Linux and open-source technologies in my spare time, driven by curiosity and a desire to stand out.\nThis decision not only sharpened my technical skills but also positioned me uniquely as a systems administrator who understood both worlds. I spent countless hours experimenting with Linux systems and delving into open-source projects. These experiences taught me not just technical skills but also contrarian thinking‚Äîa critical skill that would later define my approach to cybersecurity.\nThe Shift My first brush with cybersecurity came early during the implementation of audit controls for Windows environments at a local site. While working through these implementations, I discovered the thrill of auditors performing their detective work to assess environments for compliance.\nMy first official role was in Legal Compliance at an investment bank, focusing on eDiscovery and eRetention. This role exposed me to governance, risk, and audit functions. I quickly built up basic certifications, such as CEH, which helped me solidify my foundational knowledge.\nWith each passing year, I sought to accumulate more cybersecurity knowledge, pivoting to new roles and dedicating time to studying for certifications and applying them in real-world situations. This journey led me to roles in Security Testing, building secure systems, and managing entire security delivery services for a European retail client. Today, I have the privilege of working across third-party risk, application security, audit, and governance roles.\nLessons From the Journey Unconventional Path: Embrace the unique and non-linear career path. Each small step, no matter how unconventional, contributes to your growth. Curiosity to Learn: Always be eager to explore areas beyond your current role. For example, learning Linux while primarily working in a Windows environment broadened my skills. Multidisciplinary Skills: Developing a skill like automation or data analysis can be applied across roles. Soft Skills: Cultivate soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and empathy. These have only helped me in the long run. Humility: Stay humble throughout your journey. Recognize that there is always more to learn and that every experience, whether a success or a failure, is an opportunity for growth. Thank You My journey into cybersecurity is not just my story‚Äîit‚Äôs a collective effort shaped by the incredible mentors, peers, and colleagues I‚Äôve been fortunate to work with. To anyone aspiring to transition into cybersecurity, remember that you don‚Äôt have to do it alone. Seek mentors, connect with like-minded individuals, and pay forward the support you receive. Together, we can build a stronger, more secure future.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/articles/20241225_breaking_into_cybersecurity/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"tagline\"\u003eTagline\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou can only connect the dots in hindsight Take every opportunity to learn, even if you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs best at the time‚Ä¶ Give it your best shot, absorb the learnings, and move forward.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"about-me\"\u003eAbout Me\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith over \u003cstrong\u003e20 years in IT\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003e15+ years specializing in security\u003c/strong\u003e, I currently serve as an advisor at a US MNC.
