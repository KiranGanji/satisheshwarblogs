      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In my career spanning over two decades&lt;/strong&gt;, I came to realize that technical expertise was only one part of the puzzle when it came to professional growth. What truly made a difference was the ability to cultivate and apply essential skills that were versatile, repeatable, transferable, and impactful across both professional and personal domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this article, I attempt to highlight some of the skills that helped me shape my career journey. I hope this also offers insights into how to think about choosing skills and leveraging them to your advantage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I love this name, and I might put a lot of my creative works into this domain. But the domain itself is where I explore the unpredictable nature of life and decision-making. The concept centers around the role of probability in our everyday choices, actions, and beliefs, highlighting both favorable and unfavorable outcomes. The name &lt;a href=&#34;http://BadProbability.com&#34;&gt;BadProbability.com&lt;/a&gt; was chosen intentionally to focus on the often-overlooked, less glamorous side of probability‚Äîthe &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; outcomes that shape our experiences and how life&amp;rsquo;s uncertainties and setbacks play a significant role in our personal growth and adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hey There!&lt;/strong&gt; üëã I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;strong&gt;Satish Eshwar&lt;/strong&gt;. Thank you for visiting my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pakka Bengaluru Huduga&lt;/strong&gt; (üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)&amp;hellip; settled in this beautiful city (with its fair share of traffic, of course). üòâ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a seasoned &lt;strong&gt;cybersecurity and technology evangelist&lt;/strong&gt; with a deep appreciation for the concept of risk across all facets of life.   My insights and experience enable me to navigate the complexities of modern technology risks challenges effectively as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, the most pressing and intriguing risk I reflect on is &lt;strong&gt;climate risk&lt;/strong&gt;. I‚Äôm also fascinated by the intersection of technology and nature, particularly &lt;strong&gt;biomimicry&lt;/strong&gt;, which can offers transformative solutions to business challenges and am always building or tinkering with something new, which means I usually have my hands in a few exciting projects at once.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
