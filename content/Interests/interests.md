is dedicated to building awareness around climate change and sustainability, while also embracing my passions for biomimicry, circular economy, and the natural world. As a forest volunteer, I find immense joy in observing birds, insects, animals, and plants, celebrating life in all its forms. While the name may suggest a specific focus, the true essence of the site lies somewhere between promoting sustainable living and calling for collective action to preserve the planet for future generations in a better state than we found it (hopefully).
