# Unlocking Insights with Data Analytics: Turning Data into Actionable Strategies  

The constant risks we encountered in operations sparked my curiosity about data and its potential to provide deeper insights. i applied the same techniques when i dealt wit cybersecurity issues as well. This led me to explore tools like Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and Python libraries such as Pandas, while automating workflows using Power Automate. 

One pivotal project involved preparing a case for adding data quality indicators when none existed. By collaborating with GRC members, we defined what constituted a good data record, set up data identifiers, and developed those quality indicators. With these in place, building analytics on existing indicators became much easier, enabling us to spot trends, mitigate risks, and uncover actionable insights.  

## Why It’s Important:  
- **Data-Driven Decision-Making:** Analytics empowers you to back your decisions with evidence, reducing guesswork.  
- **Identifying Opportunities:** By spotting trends and patterns, you can uncover new opportunities for growth and improvement.  
- **Enhanced Problem-Solving:** Understanding data helps in diagnosing issues and finding targeted solutions.  

## Example:  
Using combination of Python, Power Automate & Power BI, built a dashboard that could show the current state of unmanaged third parties and risks from these unmanaged third parties.This demonstrated the transformative impact of combining data curiosity with analytics tools.
