### Tagline  
*You can only connect the dots in hindsight Take every opportunity to learn, even if you don’t know what’s best at the time… Give it your best shot, absorb the learnings, and move forward.*

### About Me  
With over **20 years in IT** and **15+ years specializing in security**, I currently serve as an advisor at a US MNC. My expertise spans various domains, including Identity, Vulnerability Management, Incident Response, Audit, Controls, Compliance, Third-Party Security, and Application Security.

### Early Days  
I started out primarily as a **helpdesk personnel**, making rounds in the office to assist users with system issues. This included fixing network problems, troubleshooting monitors, resolving application performance issues, and providing general application support.  

Coming from a **non-computer science background**, transitioning into helpdesk work was challenging but never dull. Each day brought manifold learning opportunities. I began keeping a list of things I learned, taking incremental steps each day. Before long, I was handling more complex issues and managing a site of **300 users**, supporting their servers and user systems.  

Over the next few years, my **learning curve** and **curiosity** drove me to explore various areas and roles. This journey of discovery led me to different positions, each building on the last. These transitions didn’t happen by accident.

### Curiosity  
While working as a **Windows system administrator**, I noticed most of my peers were deeply entrenched in Windows environments. I decided to explore **Linux and open-source technologies** in my spare time, driven by curiosity and a desire to stand out.  

This decision not only sharpened my technical skills but also positioned me uniquely as a systems administrator who understood both worlds. I spent countless hours experimenting with Linux systems and delving into open-source projects. These experiences taught me not just technical skills but also **contrarian thinking**—a critical skill that would later define my approach to cybersecurity.

### The Shift  
My first brush with cybersecurity came early during the implementation of **audit controls** for Windows environments at a local site. While working through these implementations, I discovered the thrill of auditors performing their detective work to assess environments for compliance.  

My first official role was in **Legal Compliance** at an investment bank, focusing on **eDiscovery and eRetention**. This role exposed me to **governance, risk, and audit functions**. I quickly built up basic certifications, such as **CEH**, which helped me solidify my foundational knowledge.  

With each passing year, I sought to accumulate more cybersecurity knowledge, pivoting to new roles and dedicating time to studying for certifications and applying them in real-world situations. This journey led me to roles in **Security Testing**, building secure systems, and managing entire security delivery services for a **European retail client**. Today, I have the privilege of working across **third-party risk, application security, audit, and governance roles**.

### Lessons From the Journey  

- **Unconventional Path**: Embrace the unique and non-linear career path. Each small step, no matter how unconventional, contributes to your growth.  
- **Curiosity to Learn**: Always be eager to explore areas beyond your current role. For example, learning Linux while primarily working in a Windows environment broadened my skills.  
- **Multidisciplinary Skills**: Developing a skill like automation or data analysis can be applied across roles.  
- **Soft Skills**: Cultivate soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and empathy. These have only helped me in the long run.  
- **Humility**: Stay humble throughout your journey. Recognize that there is always more to learn and that every experience, whether a success or a failure, is an opportunity for growth.
