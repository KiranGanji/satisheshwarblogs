**Hey There!** 👋 I'm **Satish Eshwar**. Thank you for visiting my website. 

**Pakka Bengaluru Huduga** (🙋‍♂️)... settled in this beautiful city (with its fair share of traffic, of course). 😉

I am a seasoned **cybersecurity and technology evangelist** with a deep appreciation for the concept of risk across all facets of life.   My insights and experience enable me to navigate the complexities of modern technology risks challenges effectively as well.

Personally, the most pressing and intriguing risk I reflect on is **climate risk**. I’m also fascinated by the intersection of technology and nature, particularly **biomimicry**, which can offers transformative solutions to business challenges and am always building or tinkering with something new, which means I usually have my hands in a few exciting projects at once.

Oh, and I’m an **optimist** by nature and always have a positive vibe around. I embrace a **minimalist lifestyle**, finding fulfillment in **writing, gardening, and cultivating sustainable habits**. My journey is centered on understanding risks, fostering resilience, and contributing to a secure, sustainable future. I believe when one is **truly motivated and starts showing up everyday**, wonders happen. 

With this, let’s make things happen! 🚀
